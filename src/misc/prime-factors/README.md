# Prime factors

To find prime factors of a number (N) you have to divided it by all the numbers between 2 and N-1.

If a possible factor divides the number without a remainder then it's a factor. Store it and divide the number by it.

You have to try the same factor again with the new number before continuing in case the number contains more that one copy of a factor.
