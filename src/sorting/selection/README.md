# Selection Sort

## Complexity

Worst case - O(N^2). When initial collection is sorted in reverse order.
Best case - O(N). When initial collection is already sorted.

## Algorithms

During selection sort our goal is to find the biggest element in an original array and move it to a new array. Repeat until the original array has no elements left.
