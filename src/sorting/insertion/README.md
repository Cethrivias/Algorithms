# Isertion Sort

## Complexity

Worst case - O(N^2). When initial collection is sorted in reverse order.
Best case - O(N). When initial collection is already sorted.

## Algorithm

During insertion sort we create a copy of a collection by iterating over the original collection and inserting each of its elements into it's appropriate position in the new collection
