# Linked list

Linked list is a collection of elements.

Each element contains a **value** and a **pointer** to a next element.

Last element of a list contains an empty pointer.

## Complexity

Accessing an element by it's index in a linked list has a O(N) complexity beacuse you have to traverse the list from the beginning each time.

Same is true for finding an element by its value.
