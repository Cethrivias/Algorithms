# Algorithms Cheat Sheet

# Purpose
I created this project to teach myself algorithms. At the moment there are only a couple of basic ones. Hopefuly by the time somebody reads this there will be many more.

If you see any mistakes or have suggestions please feel free to open an issue or contact me directly via email if it's visible atm.

## Complexity
### Big O Notation
**Big O notation** uses a function to describe the algorithm’s **worst-case performance** scaling related to collection size. (The program’s asymptotic performance)

> Describes worst-case performance

> The function is written within parentheses after a capital letter O.

For example, O(N^2) means an algorithm’s runtime (or memory usage or whatever you’re measuring) increases as the square of **the number of elements *(N)*** in a collection.
If you double the number of inputs, the runtime increases by roughly a factor of 4. Similarly, if you triple the number of inputs, the runtime increases by a factor of 9.
